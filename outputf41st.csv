19.5,W,"Sandeep Sharma to Christian, OUT, oh good catch. This is overpitched at off stump, Christian will back himself to hit this out of the park any day. On this occassion, he gets the bottom of the bat. It loops in front of Maxwell at long-on, but he watches it closely and moves down with it to catch it inches off the floor DT Christian c Maxwell b Sandeep Sharma 17 (11m 8b 2x4 1x6) SR: 212.50",Sandeep Sharma,Christian,Maxwell
19.4,6,"Sandeep Sharma to Christian, SIX, ...and goes short. And wide. Outside off. Sits up for Christian who walks across ever so slightly and pulls this well in front of square and over the boundary goes over the wicket",Sandeep Sharma,Christian
19.3,4,"Sandeep Sharma to Christian, FOUR, more in the slot this time. Waiting for the low full toss at leg stump, gets it, lifts it over the keeper",Sandeep Sharma,Christian

18.5,4,"Sharma to Tiwary, FOUR, no one is holding on to this though. Back of the hand slower ball, back of a length at middle stump, steps out and pulls it past Axar who can't get to it with a slide to his right at deep midwicket",Sharma,Tiwary
18.4,1,"Sharma to Christian, 1 run, slower ball, full at middle stump, gets low and sweeps this with good connection. It's dipping at Vohra at deep square leg but he keeps his eyes on the ball and holds on to it on the bounce while diving forward",Sharma,Christian

17.3,W,"Patel to Stokes, OUT, gone! Stokes' love-affair with the toe of the bat has led to his downfall. This is good length, wide outside off stump.

12.4,4,"Natarajan to Tiwary, FOUR, good looking shot. This is full and wide outside off stump, similar to Rahane's dismissal, but Tiwary has leaned in and kept low. He also has more pace - uses it to lift it inside-out and get it wide of sweeper",Natarajan,Tiwary
