But there is some doubt here.This was struck really firmly by Dhawan, Krunal did well to move initially to his left and then dish in the dive. As he completed the catch, you couldn't quite see the ball. He thinks he's taken it but there was one point where he was completely covering the ball, which means the cameras couldn't quick pick if the ball hit the turf at that instant.
